## About Me

Hi there!

I’m a senior studying Computer Science and Business at Lehigh University in Pennsylvania. I am  originally from Saigon, Vietnam and I came over to the US to study abroad during my 11th grade. I previously had a software engineering internship at Credit Karma. Besides that, I have been a TA throughout my time at Lehigh.

_**[Natural language processing 10-Ks to predict stock returns](report/report)**_

Natural language processing is a powerful tool for analyzing financial documents like 10-K forms, which provide insights into a company's financial performance and prospects. These annual reports mandated by the SEC can be cumbersome to parse manually. However, through sentiment analysis, investors can swiftly gauge the overall tone of the report, whether positive, negative, or indicative of legal risks, to make more informed investment decisions.
