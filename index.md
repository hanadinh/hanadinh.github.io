## About Me

Hi there!

I’m a senior studying Computer Science and Business at Lehigh University in Pennsylvania. I am  originally from Saigon, Vietnam and I came over to the US to study abroad during my 11th grade. I previously had a software engineering internship at Credit Karma. Besides that, I have been a TA throughout my time at Lehigh.
