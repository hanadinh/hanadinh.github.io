## About Me

Hi there!

I’m a senior studying Computer Science and Business at Lehigh University in Pennsylvania. I am an international student originally from Saigon, Vietnam and I came over to the US to study abroad during my 11th grade. I previously had a software engineering internship at Credit Karma. Besides that, I have been a TA throughout my time at Lehigh. In my free time, I like to play board games and Nintendo Switch with my friends. I also like to cook and my specialty dishes are spring rolls and Vietnamese braised pork belly.
